### NOTE: 
This is a free application I built for myself, therefore there's no code signitures meaning your system may warn you about running a program from an unverified developer - It's perfectly safe.

## To Do:

- [ ] Try and reduce framework size
- [ ] Clipboard colour formats
- [ ] Toggle for always on top
- [ ] System UI / Buttons for close, minimize etc.
